## **Usage**  
### **Commands**
#### **Works on Bots DMs or Any Channel on any Guild the Bot is a Member Of**  
**Help** - Shows list of commands.  
**Watch streamername or streamerlink** - Will get the user id and create a new list if it doesn't exist otherwise it will add the streamer to that users list.  
**Unwatch streamername or streamerlink** - Removes the streamer from that user's list.  
**Clear** - Deletes all the messages sent by the bot (1per second to avoid being rate limited).  
**List** - Generates a embed with all the watchlist streamers.  
**Configprefix** - Changes the prefix on that guild.  
**Configrole** - Changes the role given to every new member of guild.  
**Invite** - Generates bot invite link.  
**Ungerister** - Permanently deletes user's watchlist and data.  
**Stats** - Shows bots stats.  
**Restart** - Restarts the bot (available only to bot host).  
#### Replit
**It should create the secrets automatically so just change the filler text in there**
